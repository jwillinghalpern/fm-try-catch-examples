# Claris FileMaker 'Try/catch' and 'Set Auto-Commit[On/Off]' mockups

These are some mockups showing the difference between how performing transactions in Claris FileMaker looks today ([Example](./3-no-try-or-autocommit.fmfn)) vs how it could look with two new features: 1. Set Auto-Commit [On/Off], and 2. Try/Catch ([Example](./1-try-and-autocommit.fmfn))
